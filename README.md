This repository includes the spatial coordinate data of the silica nanoparticles that make up the 4 aerogel samples in our study.

Files are in the following format: x,y,z,radius in micrometers. Each row (line) is a different particle.

There are 512 files (which represent 512 structure) in each 4 folders, each containing 2,000 particles (512 x 4  2000 = over 4 million particles). The structures in these files are cubes that are periodic in x, y and z planes.

The rar files in this directory have spheres cropped from the center of the respective cubes. They have the same sturcutres with uncropped data. They were later used in electromagnetic calculations (the T-matrix method).
