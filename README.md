This repository includes the spatial coordinate data of the silica nanoparticles that make up the 4 aerogel samples in our study.
Files are in the following format: x,y,z,radius in micrometer. Each row is a different particle.
There are 4 x 512 files in the folder, each containing 2,000 particles (lines result in over 4 million particles). The structures in these files are cubes that are periodic in x, y and z planes.
The rar files in this directory are spheres cropped from the center of the respective cubes. They later used in electromagnetic calculations (the T-matrix method).
